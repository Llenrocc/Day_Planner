Description:

We are to create an interactive, responsive application for a work day planner. The planner is to be supported by moment.js, as well as using local storage to save specific events throughout the day. The app should display standard business hours (9am to 5pm). Each time slot should represent one hour and contain the following:

- The time
- Text area to hold input
- Save button (clicking on the save button will store the time and the user input in local storage)

The application is to display the current day, and each hour should be color coded to determine whether the time is in the past, present, or future.  

I used free stock office photos from "https://www.pexels.com/search/office/", moment.js, notes, and google to help me through this project.
